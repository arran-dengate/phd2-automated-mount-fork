-- Fork disclaimer --

This is a fork of PHD2, an astronomy telescope guiding program. (https://github.com/OpenPHDGuiding/phd2)

I modified the code to run with our custom scope. Main changes were:
1) modifying the guider to use our experimental, very unusual mount (probably useless to anyone else)
2) adding an auto calibration routine that takes several readings to recognise where the telescope is pointing in the sky
3) modifying the interface to be usable with a touchscreen attached to the mount

This worked, but never got beyond an early stage; the project was discontinued for other reasons in 2017.

This is exploratory code with no test coverage. Use at your own risk.
