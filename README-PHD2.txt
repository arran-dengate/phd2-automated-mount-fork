Welcome to PHD2 Release Version 2.6.2

PHD2 is the next generation of the original PHD Guiding application
from Stark Labs, now restructured, enhanced, and supported by an
open-source community of volunteers.  PHD2's new built-in help file is
an excellent way to get started using the program, regardless of
whether you've had previous experience with the original PHD.

or for bug reports, feature requests, and questions about PHD2
development, please join the discussion in the Open PHD Guiding google
group,
